HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS
Week 7 – Statistical Business Analysis
--------------------------------------------------

1. One-Sample T-Test (Sales Mean)
--------------------------------------------------
Test Purpose:
To check whether the average sales value is statistically different from the population mean.

Test Statistic (t): 0.0000
P-value: 1.0000

Interpretation:
The p-value is greater than 0.05, indicating no statistically significant difference.
The null hypothesis is ACCEPTED.


2. Two-Sample T-Test
--------------------------------------------------
Test Purpose:
To compare the means of two independent numerical variables from the sales dataset.

Test Statistic (t): -18.5403
P-value: 5.7038e-34

Interpretation:
The p-value is far less than 0.05, indicating a statistically significant difference.
The null hypothesis is REJECTED.


3. ANOVA Test
--------------------------------------------------
Test Purpose:
To determine whether there are statistically significant differences between
the means of three or more numerical variables.

F-Statistic: 124.8156
P-value: 4.5364e-40

Interpretation:
The p-value is much smaller than 0.05, indicating strong statistical significance.
The null hypothesis is REJECTED.


--------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
• One hypothesis test was NOT statistically significant.
• Two hypothesis tests were statistically significant.
• Statistical evidence strongly supports meaningful differences in business metrics.
